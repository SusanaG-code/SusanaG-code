### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Susana! Iâ€™m a Front-End developer who believes that FE is not just the pretty face of web development, but a meaningful way to make people understand and care about the information.

Iâ€™ve lived in three countries and worked in different work environments which has made me an adaptable professional who sees changes as opportunities and different opinions as new perspectives.

My programming journey has taught me that knowledge without understanding is useless, that technology evolves fast and you shouldn't take anything for granted, and that learning is a never ending road.

I am looking forward to join a project that will help me to develop my code skills and excited to bring my energy and enthusiasm to it!

When I am not practicing Javascript on the keyboard, I grab my acoustic guitar. Blues lover. 

P.D.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Javascript and Html/CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on amazing projects that help me to develop my code skills.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about.. any code questions!
